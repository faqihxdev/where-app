# WhereApp - Lost and Found Application

## What is WhereApp?

WhereApp is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help people report lost items or request information about lost items. It provides both a list view and a map view for lost items, making it easier for users to locate and recover their belongings.

## Why WhereApp?

Losing personal items can be a stressful experience. WhereApp aims to simplify the process of reporting and finding lost items by providing a user-friendly platform that connects people who have lost items with those who have found them. By leveraging modern web technologies and a robust tech stack, WhereApp offers a seamless and efficient solution to a common problem.

## How it Works

- Report lost items
- Post found items
- Search for lost items
- View items on a map

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aqilakmal/Where-App.git
   cd whereapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Add a web app to your Firebase project
   - Copy the Firebase configuration
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase config:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite)

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the project's coding standards and structure.

3. Test your changes locally:
   - Run the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Check for any console errors or warnings
   - Ensure the feature works as expected
   - If you see uncontrollable ðŸ”¥in your devtools console, `Ctr+C` on your terminal to terminate the app
   - If you stopped it in time, you have saved the team from going bankrupt

4. Lint and format your code:
   ```
   npm run lint
   npm run format
   ```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

6. Push your changes to your branch:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a pull request on GitHub for review.

### Important Development Notes

- Use TypeScript for all new files and components.
- Utilize Jotai for state management. Add new atoms and selectors in the appropriate files under the `/stores` directory.
- Style components using Tailwind CSS classes. Use Chakra UI components for "bigger components".
- Keep components small and focused. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions.
- Update `types.ts` when adding or modifying data structures.
- Follow the existing patterns in `ListingForm.tsx`, `EditListingPage.tsx`, and `PostPage.tsx` when creating new forms or pages.
- Use the `imageStore.ts` for handling image-related operations.
- Refer to `listingStore.ts` and `userStore.ts` for examples of how to structure Firestore interactions.
